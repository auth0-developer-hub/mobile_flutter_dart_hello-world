# Flutter/Dart: Starter Mobile App Code Sample

This Dart code sample demonstrates how to build mobile applications using Flutter.

Visit the ["Flutter Security: Developer Guides"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/guides/mobile/flutter) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources) to explore how you can secure Flutter applications written in Dart by implementing endpoint protection and authorization with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the Flutter Project

To run the project and start the Flutter app, make sure you are in the root directory, then run:

```bash
flutter run
```
